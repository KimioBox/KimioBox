## Description

This is a wonderful initiative by 
["kurioso"](https://www.thingiverse.com/kurioso/about). It's 
a box to decorate the chemotherapy bags of children with 
cancer. As it is stated in [the 
original](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2808979):

```
Covers for children intravenous bags. A child-friendly 
version for a best treatment.
"If you take this, you will be as strong as batman". That's 
the idea

```
